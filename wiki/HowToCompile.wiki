This page contains instructions how-to compile Geoid

== Under Linux ==
To install Geoid you need subversion to obtain source code and Qt4 development libraries to compile it. The way you install these packages depends on your distribution.
For example, under ubuntu you can execute this command:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev subversion
}}}
Once you installed this libraries you can get the source code of Geoid and compile it:
{{{
svn checkout http://geoid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ geoid
cd geoid
qmake
make
}}}
Geoid executable binary will appear in bin/ subfolder


== Under Windows ==
First of all you should install Qt development libraries and MinGW(which is a Windows port of GNU Compileres). Qt setup file is available here: http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows . During installation it will offer you to download MinGW - you should agree with it.
Next step is installing subversion.
